# SB-Recommendation-GNN
A dynamic session based recommender system with graph neural networks.

Datasets: 
Datasets used in this project are:
1. Yoochoose: available at https://www.kaggle.com/code/raceproptit/yoochose
2. Diginetica : available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecSysDatasets/blob/master/conversion_tools/usage/DIGINETICA.md

TemporalGNN model:
TemooralGNN_Diginetica.ipynb and TemporalGNN_Yoochoose.ipynb files contain preprocessing and model implementation on Yoochoose and Diginetica datasets.

Baselines:
Baseline methods used in this project are KNN and Node2Vec. Implementation of KNN and Node2Vec on Yoochoose and Diginetica datasets are available in Baselines folder.
